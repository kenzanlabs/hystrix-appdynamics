# Instrumenting Appdynamics
Appdynamics will need to be configured in the UI to start collecting data points from the method ```markEvents()``` method in ```com.kenzan.hystrix.appdynamics.hook.AppdHystrixCommandExecutionHook``` class. The method will be called on every event triggered during a Hystrix Lifecycle and will have the current command Instance to collect the following data points.

- ExecutionEvents
- ExecutionTimeInMilliseconds
- RollingMaxConcurrentExecutions
- NumberEmissions
- NumberFallbackEmissions
- CurrentConcurrentExecutionCount
- Hystrix Events emitted during the lifecycle
